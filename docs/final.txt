CourtVision Analytics - Final Project Reflection
================================================

Key Lessons Learned:
--------------------
- Django's split settings approach (base.py, development.py, production.py) provides excellent separation of concerns and makes deployment much cleaner
- Building reusable template components with Django's template inheritance system significantly reduces code duplication
- Implementing proper ORM queries with annotations and aggregations is essential for building analytics dashboards efficiently
- User authentication with @login_required decorators provides a simple but effective way to protect sensitive features

Challenges Faced:
-----------------
- Integrating external NBA API data while maintaining consistent database schema required careful planning of the sync mechanism
- Generating dynamic charts with Matplotlib and embedding them as base64 images required understanding of the image encoding process
- Managing user predictions and calculating community voting percentages required complex ORM queries with annotations
- Ensuring the UI remained responsive and professional across different screen sizes with Bootstrap 5

Future Improvements:
--------------------
- Implement real-time score updates using WebSockets or polling
- Add machine learning model for more accurate game predictions based on historical data
- Create a mobile app version using Django REST Framework as the backend
- Add social features like following other users and sharing predictions
- Implement email notifications for game reminders and prediction results
