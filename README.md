# Final Project: Trading Journal and Performance Analyzer

This web application provides a comprehensive solution for traders to log their trades and analyze their performance. It features a secure user authentication system, a detailed trade entry form, and a paginated history of all past trades. The core of the project is a dynamic performance dashboard that displays key metrics like total profit/loss, win rate, and average gain/loss, alongside an equity curve chart to visualize account growth over time.
